"""Whether a change touches code, so the jobs that judge only code can skip one that does not.

A pull request that changes only documentation holds runners for clippy, the
test suite, the coverage run, the MSRV build, the dependency policy, the image
build and the CodeQL analysis, and none of them can answer differently than it
did on the base. So each of those jobs asks this first, through a `what changed`
job, and skips where the answer is no.

The answer is no only where every changed path is one this repository names as
read by no code-judging job. The list names paths rather than kinds of file, so
a file of a kind nobody has thought about runs every job. `LICENSE` is not on
it, because the crate names it as its `license-file` and `cargo-deny` reads it.

Only an added or modified file can be code-free. A rename arrives as a deletion
and an addition, and a deletion is code: what it removes may be something a job
reads.

Asked about nothing it can compare — no base, a base that is not a commit here,
a push that opened a branch — it answers yes. So does a run that fails: the jobs
asking run whenever this job did not succeed.

Usage:
  the_code_a_change_touches.py <base>    decide for HEAD against <base>
  the_code_a_change_touches.py --self-test
Writes `code=true` or `code=false` to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` where it is set, and says
which paths decided it. Exit 0 = decided, 1 = the self-test found a claim broken.
