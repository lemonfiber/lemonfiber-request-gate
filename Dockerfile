# The request gate's image: built from this repository, distroless, non-root.
#
# The build stage compiles a static binary for the platform being built; the image
# holds that binary and nothing else, with no shell and no package manager. Its
# health check is the binary asking itself, since the image has no HTTP client to
# ask with.
